# h1  journal day 5

Today was a rough day for a number of reasons. One, our teacher was sick and understandably cannot make it. Two, the explanation of the lab was not very helpful. Three, it is the end of week one and I feel like I do not understand a lot of stuff. I am going to just have to try harder next week.
